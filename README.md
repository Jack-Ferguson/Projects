# Projects
A collection of fun projects I've made
These projects were created based on ideas from friends, so project scope varies wildly.

Some P5.js Projects must be opened using a local server, as browsers will block access to local files otherwise.

Unfortunately the builds for Processing projects are too large to upload to github. If you would like to run them, you can download Processing from [https://processing.org](https://processing.org/download).

The Particle Simulation vanilla java project was created for a class project, so it includes some design documents.
